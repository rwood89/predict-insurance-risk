## Purpose

The Jupyter notebook, pred_ins_risk.ipynb, demonstrates the execution of a Data Science request received at an insurance company. The notebook covers defining the problem statement, synthesis of data to replicate a real-word dataset, and developing a machine learning (ML) model.

The model aims to predict the probability or risk of a customer filing a claim within one year of policy purchase, resulting in a loss for the business. Documentation is provided in an easily explainable and transparent manner, in order to walk stakeholders through the methodology and increase confidence in ML across the business.
